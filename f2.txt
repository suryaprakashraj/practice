Regression testing is a software testing process that verifies that recent changes to the code, like bug fixes or new features, haven't negatively impacted existing functionality. It ensures that the software continues to work as expected after new changes, preventing regressions (new or returning bugs). 
Key aspects of regression testing:
Ensures stability:
It verifies that new changes haven't introduced unintended side effects or broken previously working features. 
Identifies and fixes issues:
It helps catch bugs that might have been introduced by new code changes, ensuring the reliability and quality of the software.
